## Install OpenEverest Using Helm (Recommended)

Helm is the recommended installation method for OpenEverest as it simplifies deployment and resource management in Kubernetes environments.

### Prerequisites

- Ensure you have a Kubernetes cluster set up (e.g., Amazon EKS, Google GKE).
- Install Helm on your local machine: [Helm Installation Guide](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/).

### Steps to Install

1. **Add the Percona Helm repository:**

```bash
helm repo add percona https://percona.github.io/percona-helm-charts/
helm repo update
```

2. **Install the OpenEverest Helm Chart:**

```bash
helm install everest-core percona/everest \
--namespace everest-system \
--create-namespace
```

3. **Retrieve Admin Credentials:**

```bash
kubectl get secret everest-accounts -n everest-system -o jsonpath='{.data.users\.yaml}' | base64 --decode | yq '.admin.passwordHash'
```

- Default username: **admin**
- You can set a different default admin password by using the server.initialAdminPassword parameter during installation.

4. **Access the OpenEverest UI:**

   By default, OpenEverest is not exposed via an external IP. Use one of the following options:

- Port Forwarding:

```bash
kubectl port-forward svc/everest 8080:8080 -n everest-system
```

Access the UI at http://127.0.0.1:8080.

For more information about our Helm charts, visit the official [OpenEverest Helm Charts repository](https://github.com/percona/percona-helm-charts/tree/main/charts/everest).

## Install OpenEverest using CLI


### Prerequisites

- Ensure you have a Kubernetes cluster set up (e.g., Amazon EKS, Google GKE).

- Verify access to your Kubernetes cluster:

  ```bash
  kubectl get nodes
  ```

- Ensure your `kubeconfig` file is located in the default path `~/.kube/config`. If not, set the path using the following command:

  ```bash
  export KUBECONFIG=~/.kube/config
  ```

## Steps to Install

Starting from version **1.4.0**, `everestctl` uses the Helm chart to install OpenEverest. You can configure chart parameters using:

- `--helm.set` for individual parameters.
- `--helm.values` to provide a values file.

1. **Download the OpenEverest CLI:**

   Linux and WSL

   ```sh
   curl -sSL -o everestctl-linux-amd64 https://github.com/openeverest/openeverest/releases/latest/download/everestctl-linux-amd64
   sudo install -m 555 everestctl-linux-amd64 /usr/local/bin/everestctl
   rm everestctl-linux-amd64
   ```

   macOS (Apple Silicon)

   ```sh
   curl -sSL -o everestctl-darwin-arm64 https://github.com/openeverest/openeverest/releases/latest/download/everestctl-darwin-arm64
   sudo install -m 555 everestctl-darwin-arm64 /usr/local/bin/everestctl
   rm everestctl-darwin-arm64

   ```

   macOS (Intel CPU)

   ```sh
   curl -sSL -o everestctl-darwin-amd64 https://github.com/openeverest/openeverest/releases/latest/download/everestctl-darwin-amd64
   sudo install -m 555 everestctl-darwin-amd64 /usr/local/bin/everestctl
   rm everestctl-darwin-amd64

   ```

2. **Install OpenEverest Using the Wizard:**

   Run the following command and specify the namespaces for OpenEverest to manage:

   ```sh
   everestctl install
   ```

   If you skip adding namespaces, you can add them later:

   ```bash
   everestctl namespaces add <NAMESPACE>
   ```

3. **Install OpenEverest in Headless Mode:**

   Run the following command to set namespaces and database operators during installation:

   ```bash
   everestctl install --namespaces <namespace-name1>,<namespace-name2> --operator.mongodb=true --operator.postgresql=true --operator.mysql=true --skip-wizard
   ```

4. **Access Admin Credentials:**

   Retrieve the generated admin password:

   ```bash
   everestctl accounts initial-admin-password
   ```

5. **Access the OpenEverest UI:**

   Use one of the following methods to access the UI:

- Port Forwarding:

  ```bash
  kubectl port-forward svc/everest 8080:8080 -n everest-system
  ```

  Open the UI at http://127.0.0.1:8080.

- LoadBalancer (Optional):

  ```bash
  kubectl patch svc/everest -n everest-system -p '{"spec": {"type": "LoadBalancer"}}'
  ```
